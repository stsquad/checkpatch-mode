* Introduction

This is a simple minor-mode for running checkpatch scripts.

A checkpatch script is a script that will scan a patch or file and
check the code meets a number of criteria. This sort of automatic code
review is encouraged as it means people will spend less time
correcting stylistic mistakes and can concentrate on the core code
changes.

* User functions

There are currently two functions you can run:

  - checkpatch-run-against-file
  - checkpatch-run-from-magit

The second function it for calling from magit and will only work if
(magit-commit-at-point) finds a commit (e.g. point is at a log entry).

* Implementation Details

This minor mode is a derived from compilation-mode. The
checkpatch-mode-regex is currently tuned to the output from the Linux
kernel checkpatch.

* Future work
** TODO Make checkpatch-find-script-or-prompt smarter
Currently we set the script path as a local variable when we are first
called however we could be smarter looking at common locations.
